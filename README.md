# The script automatically pushes the keys for the user.

If you are lazy enough that you don't feel like mashing three keys then this program is perfect for you.

It is mainly intended for Metin2 but can be used for other games if you modify it accordingly.

Currently it is set for the valium.pl server, although it is not difficult to modify it to work for other games/windows.

To use the script, you need to download AHK and compile it with this program.
